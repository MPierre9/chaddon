Chaddon is a browser extension that detects an active tabâ€™s url and connects you with other users currently browsing the same domain to a dynamic chatroom.

This project has been developed and maintained by [Michael Pierre](https://github.com/MPierre9), [Evan Davies](https://github.com/EmdaviesSeneca), [Geoff McCollam](https://github.com/GeoffMcCollam) and [Marco Beltempo](https://github.com/marcobeltempo)
 

Although Chaddon is still in its early stages, the team plans to have the extension publicly available in the Chrome Webstore by late April 2018.

For now feel free to download the source code to test the extension locally or try the demo over at [app.chaddon.ca](http://app.chaddon.ca)
